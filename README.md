# Waddle-Game
I wanted to create a game simmilar to one I played as a little one so I could later write code for a nueral network to learn how to play it. I'm using Python 3.10.11 which depending on what version of python you are using may change things a little bit due to floor division. If I haven't yet optimized the code for speed  by reducing calculations I'll get to it soon. I hope you enjoy!
Also here are two songs for fun: 1. [Devil Town](https://youtu.be/KvaxYUfGHnk?si=LlmHANwcVYulq5gl)  and 2. [Cigarettes out the Window](https://youtu.be/7j6C9METNm0?si=ZG9F79sy8DUstlWu)
